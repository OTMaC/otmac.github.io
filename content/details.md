The contest will be held in-person around the end of November 2023.  

## Registration

To register a team for the contest, send us an email (`hello -at- otmac -dot- ca`) and include a list of all your team members. 

## Competition Style

We have multiple stages to our competition - similar to HMMT and SuMAC. The winners overall will be determined by their performances in each section/stage. In any given round, problems can appear from combinatorics, number theory, algebra, and geometry. It is guaranteed that no calculation will require calculus. Calculators are not allowed.

### Individual 

For this round, each person has an hour to answer 10 short answer questions with an integer between 0 and 999. The team score is determined by the sum of each team members score. 

### Team  

Teams of four will compete against each other with 20 short answer problems. However, each problem will have a different point value and the score for the round will be the sum of all problem values solved.  

### Tournament 

The top 4 teams based on Individuals and Teams will face each other in a elimination tournament to determine the final 3 winners.
