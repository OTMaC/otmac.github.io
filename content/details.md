## Competition Style

We have multiple stages to our competition - similar to HMMT and CTMC, if you've participated in those contests before. There's going to be two rounds: Team Round (1 hour, 20 multiple choice + 5 integer solution) and Knockout Round (Head-to-Head best-of-4 1v1 duels). In any given round, problems can appear from combinatorics, number theory, algebra, and geometry with the guarantee that calculus is not required. Calculators are not allowed.
