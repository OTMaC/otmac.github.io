## Competition Style

We have multiple stages to our competition - similar to HMMT and CTMC, if you've participated in those contests before. There's going to be three rounds and the winners will be decided based on their performances in all the stages. In any given round, problems can appear from combinatorics, number theory, algebra, and geometry with the guarantee that calculus is not required. Calculators are not allowed. The three rounds that will take place are Individual, Team, and Tournament. 

### Individual 

This will be the first round lasting 1 hour. Each person will work by themselves and a team's overall score will be the sum of each of the individual scores. The responses will be short answer (so showing your work is not necessary).  

### Team  

In this round, 20 multiple choice problems will be given and everyone in a team will work together to solve these problems in 50 minutes.

### Tournament 

The final round will be a tournament style competition between the top four teams based on Individual and Team scores. The four teams will compete against one another with the team that solves the problems first progressing onto the next round.
